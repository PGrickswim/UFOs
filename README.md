## Overview of Project
Everybody has heard the stories: unexplained lights in the sky. Is it an aircraft? A military craft? Something else?? 

The present study seeks to make aggregated data about UFO sightings accessible to a wide range of users by building basic JavaScript and HTML functionality to create a table display and filter capability. By understanding timing, frequency, location, and type of UFO sighting, we can better determine what may be explainable versus what truly is in the realm of the unexplained.

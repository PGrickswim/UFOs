# UFOs

## Overview of Project
Everybody has heard the stories: unexplained lights in the sky. Is it an aircraft? A military craft? Something else?? 

The present study seeks to make aggregated data about UFO sightings accessible to a wide range of users by building basic JavaScript and HTML functionality to create a table display and filter capability. By understanding timing, frequency, location, and type of UFO sighting, we can better determine what may be explainable versus what truly is in the realm of the unexplained.

## Results

### How to use the webpage

When you open the website, you are able to see the below image. Note that there are 5 filters on the left and a table on the right. 

#### Webpage

To properly filter, complete the following steps:
1. Enter a date, if desired
2. Enter a specific city, if desired
3. Enter a specific state, if desired, by using the two-letter postal code for that state
4. Enter a specific country, if desired. United States is shown as "us"
5. Enter a specific shape of UFO, if desired. 

Upon hitting the "enter" key, the filter will update based on the user input. Below are two examples of results based on entering filters for "Fireball" shape, and multiple filters with "el cajon" as the city and "ca" as the state. Note that the form is also able to accept multiple filters and add the appropriate data to the table display. 

#### Search For "fireball"

#### Search for "el cajon" and "ca"

## Summary 
While this search is a good start, there are some drawbacks to the current layout and functionality. One main one is that the filter functions are removed "off to the side" of the index headers in the main table. Accessing the filter functionality would work most intuitively if there was an option to filter by accessing the index headers directly. 

In addition to this, there are 2 recommendations for further development:
1. Search functionality to specify duration of event
2. A search box to "find" specific text within the comments column.

In conclusion, the simple search functionality provided by this page offers a great starting point to access UFO data in a straightforward way; however, with some enhancements and increased capabilities, we can really take this project and webpage to the next level.

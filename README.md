## Overview of Project
Everybody has heard the stories: unexplained lights in the sky. Is it an aircraft? A military craft? Something else?? 

The present study seeks to make aggregated data about UFO sightings accessible to a wide range of users by building basic JavaScript and HTML functionality to create a table display and filter capability. By understanding timing, frequency, location, and type of UFO sighting, we can better determine what may be explainable versus what truly is in the realm of the unexplained.

## Results

### How to use the webpage

When you open the website, you are able to see the below image. Note that there are 5 filters on the left and a table on the right.

To properly filter, complete the following steps:
1. Enter a date, if desired
2. Enter a specific city, if desired
3. Enter a specific state, if desired, by using the two-letter postal code for that state
4. Enter a specific country, if desired. United States is shown as "us"
5. Enter a specific shape of UFO, if desired. 

Upon hitting the "enter" key, the filter will update based on the user input. Below are two examples of results based on entering filters for "Fireball" shape, and "El Cajon" as the city. Note that the form is also able to accept multiple filters and add the appropriate data to the table display.
